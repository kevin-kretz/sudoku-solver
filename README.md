# Sudoku Puzzle Solver

I made this program to solve the puzzles how I would in real life. First it finds an empty cell. Then if figures out which numbers are possible based on its row, column and nonet. If there is only one number possible it fills it in. If there is one possibility, it keeps note of the possible numbers and moves on to the next square. Then it cycles trhough until there everything has been filled in.
